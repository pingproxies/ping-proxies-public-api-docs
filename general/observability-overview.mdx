The **Network Observability Panel** provides real-time and historical insights into your proxy infrastructure. This panel is designed to give you comprehensive visibility across all usage dimensions—hostnames, proxy users, networks, and Smartpath® performance metrics—without needing third-party analytics tools.

## Why use Observability?

Whether you are debugging traffic anomalies, optimizing performance, or planning capacity, the Observability Panel helps you make data-driven decisions quickly and confidently. All key metrics and breakdowns are accessible in a single interface with intuitive filtering and real-time updates.

## Key Features

### Real-Time Metrics and Historical Data

- Monitor live traffic as it happens with minimal delay
- Access up to **90 days of historical data** to identify long-term trends and anomalies
- View bandwidth usage charts and request volume over time

### Advanced Filtering Options

The panel allows for precise filtering across multiple dimensions:

- Hostname
- Proxy User
- Network Type (Residential, ISP, Datacenter)
- Time Span (Custom ranges with support for hourly to 90-day windows)

Filters support advanced operators such as `equals`, `not equals`, `contains`, and `greater than`.

### Top-Level Metrics

The top summary section includes:

- **Requests**: Total number of proxy requests
- **Bytes Usage**: Bandwidth consumption in gigabytes
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed or errored requests

These metrics update in near real-time and reflect the currently selected date range and filters.

## Hostnames, Users, and Networks

### Top Hostnames

Understand where your traffic is going. The panel lists the top 100 hostnames by:

- Request count
- Bandwidth usage
- Error rates

This helps in diagnosing domain-specific issues or validating traffic targets.

### Top Proxy Users

Gain visibility into your heaviest users:

- Track request volume and bandwidth consumption per user
- Identify abnormal usage patterns
- Pinpoint users causing elevated error rates

### Network Distribution

View traffic split by:

- Residential
- ISP
- Datacenter

Percentages and total volume are displayed clearly to assess distribution across your available network types.

## Smartpath® Metrics

If Smartpath is enabled for your account, the observability panel includes the following metrics:

| Metric                   | Description                                                |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| AI Optimized Requests    | Number of requests routed intelligently via Smartpath      |
| AI Optimized Bytes       | Bandwidth optimized through Smartpath routing decisions    |
| Money Saved              | Estimated cost savings achieved with Smartpath             |

These metrics are filterable and help measure Smartpath’s impact across specific users, domains, and time periods.

## Network Activity Table

At the bottom of the observability panel, a detailed activity table logs all traffic events by the hour, grouped by:

- Timestamp
- Proxy User
- Hostname
- Network Type
- Request Count
- Bytes Usage
- Smartpath Savings
- Billed Bytes
