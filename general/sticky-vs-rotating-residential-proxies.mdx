## Sticky Residential Proxies

Sticky proxies assign a single IP address to a user for an extended period. When you use a sticky proxy, you maintain the same residential IP address across multiple requests, providing consistency for your online activities.

**Key features:**
- Consistent IP address for an extended duration
- Longer session persistence
- Better suited for maintaining user accounts or sessions
- More closely mimics regular user behavior

**Common use cases:**
- Accessing geo-restricted content
- Managing multiple social media accounts
- E-commerce operations requiring consistent identity
- Login-based website interactions

<Note>
  Sticky sessions can return the same IP address for up to 24 hours. However, since our proxies are sourced through real residential devices, IP availability is not guaranteed and a specific IP address may occasionally become offline.
</Note>

## Rotating Residential Proxies

Rotating proxies automatically change the IP address assigned to a user after each request. This provides a new residential IP for every connection you make.

**Key features:**
- Dynamic IP address allocation
- Shorter session duration
- Higher level of anonymity
- More difficult to track or block

**Common use cases:**
- Web scraping and data collection
- Price comparison
- Ad verification
- SEO monitoring
