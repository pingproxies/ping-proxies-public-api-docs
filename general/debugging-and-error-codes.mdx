Understanding and resolving failed proxy requests is crucial to maintaining reliable infrastructure. We provide a powerful [**Live Log Viewer**](https://dashboard.pingproxies.com/observability/live) combined with traceable request identifiers to help you debug issues efficiently and in real time.

## Identifying Failed Requests

Every authenticated request that passes through our network includes a special response header:

```http
x-ping-request-id: 90c1d76f-4551-4d15-9087-b37421d6b7c7
```

This `x-ping-request-id` is a unique identifier tied to that request's **Log ID** in the [Live Network Activity Viewer](/docs/live-network-activity). You can use this ID to locate and inspect the exact request, its metadata, and its outcome.

## Debugging with cURL

You can inspect your proxy request headers and outcomes using the `curl` CLI. Below is an example of a successful proxy tunnel request, which returns an `x-ping-request-id` header:

```bash
curl --proxy 124.103.51.11:8000 --proxy-user example_user:example_pass --verbose https://ipinfo.io
```

Example output (truncated for readability):

```
> CONNECT ipinfo.io:443 HTTP/1.1
> Proxy-Authorization: Basic ZXhhbXBsZV91c2VyOmV4YW1wbGVfcGFzcw==
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< x-ping-request-id: 90c1d76f-4551-4d15-9087-b37421d6b7c7
...
```

You can now go to the **Live Activity** section in your dashboard, locate the Log ID `90c1d76f-4551-4d15-9087-b37421d6b7c7`, and inspect:

- Network used
- Proxy IP address
- Target domain
- Duration and bytes
- Internal error code (if failed)

## Common Error Codes and Troubleshooting

We do not expose HTTP status codes due to TLS encryption. Instead, errors are represented by internal codes shown in the [**Live Network Activity Viewer**](https://dashboard.pingproxies.com/observability/live).

Below is a comprehensive list of these codes with their descriptions:

| Error Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **200**        | **Successful / No Error** |
| 0â€“9        | Authentication failed or target blacklisted |
| 10â€“19      | Internal service failed to execute |
| 20â€“29      | Unrecognised protocol received |
| 30â€“39      | Failed to connect to target |
| 40â€“59      | Failed to establish proxy tunnel |
| 90         | Error during connection |
| 1000â€“1001  | Invalid credentials provided |
| 1003       | Password is required |
| 1004       | Username is required |
| 1102       | Bandwidth limit exceeded for your plan |
| 1103       | Too many concurrent connections |
| 1104       | Authentication format is invalid |
| 2001       | Your IP address is blocked |
| 2002â€“2007  | Target website is restricted |
| 2008       | Rate limit exceeded â€“ please wait |
| 2009       | Target port is not permitted |
| 2010       | Connection limit reached |
| 2011       | Target website is restricted |
| 3001       | Internal server error occurred |
| 3002       | Required parameters are missing |
| 3003       | Unsupported protocol requested |
| 3004       | Internal server error occurred |
| 3200       | Failed to connect to target |
| 4000       | Connection tunnel failed |
| 9101       | Client connection error |
| 9102       | Client communication failed |
| 9103       | Target server unreachable |
| 9104       | Target connection failed |
| 9108       | Domain name could not be resolved |
| 9200â€“9202  | Request format is invalid |

### Suggested Fixes

- **Authentication Errors (0â€“9, 1000â€“1004)**: Verify your proxy username and password. Double-check authentication format.
- **Target Restricted (2000 range)**: The target website or port may be blocked by your plan or region. Try a different network or contact support.
- **Bandwidth or Connection Limits (1102â€“2010)**: Upgrade your plan or reduce simultaneous requests.
- **Protocol Errors (20â€“29, 3003)**: Ensure you are using supported protocols like HTTP/HTTPS.
- **Client Errors (9100s)**: Review your applicationâ€™s outbound behaviorâ€”could be firewall, DNS, or socket related.

## Still Need Help?

If you cannot resolve the issue using the Log ID and error code, please reach out to our support team with:

- The full `x-ping-request-id` (If within 7 days of the issue and request)
- Target domain
- Approximate timestamp
- Proxy credentials used (if applicable)
