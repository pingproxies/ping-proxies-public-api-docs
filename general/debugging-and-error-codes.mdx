Understanding and resolving failed proxy requests is crucial to maintaining reliable infrastructure. We provide a powerful [**Live Log Viewer**](https://dashboard.pingproxies.com/observability/live) combined with traceable request identifiers to help you debug issues efficiently and in real time.

## Identifying Failed Requests

Every authenticated request that passes through our network includes a special response header:

```http
x-ping-request-id: 90c1d76f-4551-4d15-9087-b37421d6b7c7
```

This `x-ping-request-id` is a unique identifier tied to that request's **Log ID** in the [Live Network Activity Viewer](/docs/live-network-activity). You can use this ID to locate and inspect the exact request, its metadata, and its outcome.

## Debugging with cURL

You can inspect your proxy request headers and outcomes using the `curl` CLI. Below is an example of a successful proxy tunnel request, which returns an `x-ping-request-id` header:

```bash
curl --proxy 124.103.51.11:8000 --proxy-user example_user:example_pass --verbose https://ipinfo.io
```

Example output (truncated for readability):

```
> CONNECT ipinfo.io:443 HTTP/1.1
> Proxy-Authorization: Basic ZXhhbXBsZV91c2VyOmV4YW1wbGVfcGFzcw==
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< x-ping-request-id: 90c1d76f-4551-4d15-9087-b37421d6b7c7
...
```

You can now go to the **Live Activity** section in your dashboard, locate the Log ID `90c1d76f-4551-4d15-9087-b37421d6b7c7`, and inspect:

- Network used
- Proxy IP address
- Target domain
- Duration and bytes
- Internal error code (if failed)

## Common Error Codes and Troubleshooting
We do not expose HTTP status codes due to TLS encryption. Instead, errors are represented by internal codes shown in the [**Live Network Activity Viewer**](https://dashboard.pingproxies.com/observability/live).


These errors are broken down into sub-categories.

- Authentication Errors (1000 - 1999)
- Routing Errors (2000 - 2999)
- Connection Errors (3000 - 3999)
- Tunneling Errors  (4000 - 4999)
- General Errors (9000 - 9999)

We also expose a single HTTP-style error code `301`, returned only when you try to reach a HTTP target on our residential network, which only allows HTTPS targets.

Below is a comprehensive list of all error codes and their descriptions:

| Error Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **200**        | **Successful / No Error** |

    301          | Request redirected to HTTPS |

    1000 - 1100  | Failed to authenticate |
    1102         | Bandwidth limit exceeded for oyu plan |
    1103         | Too many concurrent connections |
    1104         | HTTP proxy authentication eader was badly formed |

    2000         | GeneralRouteError |
    2002         | Target website is restricted |
    2102         | Internal server error occurred |

    3000 - 3200  | Internal server error ocurred |

    4000 - 4102  | Internal server error occurred |
    4103         | Connection was unused for too long |

    9100 - 9104  | Unexpected EOF during operation. Not necessarily a bad thing. |

    9108         | General DNS failure |
    9109         | Domain name could not be resolved |

    9201         | Protocol used was badly formed. Check client and libraries. |

    9300         | We forcibly closed your connection. Your proxies might have expired. |
    9301         | Connection was used for too long |


### Suggested Fixes
- **Authentication Errors (1000-1100, 1104)**: Verify your proxy username and password. Double-check authentication format.
- **Bandwidth or Connection Limits (1102, 1103)**: Upgrade your plan or reduce simultaneous requests.
- **Target Restricted (2002)**: The target website or port may be blocked by your plan or region. Try a different network or contact support.

## Still Need Help?

If you cannot resolve the issue using the Log ID and error code, please reach out to our support team with:

- The full `x-ping-request-id` (If within 7 days of the issue and request)
- Target domain
- Approximate timestamp
- Proxy credentials used (if applicable)
