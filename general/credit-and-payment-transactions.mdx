You can view all payment transaction and credit transactions in your dashboard at the Billing Transaction section of your dashboard. Here you can see all payment events and credit events that have occurred on your account.

## Payment Transactions

The default view of the dashboard will show your Payment Transactions such as payments from cards or cryptocurrency. If you'd like to see store credit payments and top ups, you can click the drop down and select Credit Transactions.

## Transaction Details

On both pages, you'll see invoice including:

- Transaction date and time (UTC)
- Transaction amount
- Payment Card
- Transaction Status
- Credit Transaction reason
- The invoice that is related to your Payment Transaction or Credit Transaction

If you don't recognise a transaction then feel free to reach out to support@pingproxies.com or open a ticket in your dashboard.
