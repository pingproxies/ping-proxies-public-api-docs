## Understanding Proxies

A **proxy server** acts as an intermediary between your device and the internet. When you use a proxy, your internet traffic is routed through the proxy server before reaching its final destination. This means websites and online services see the proxy's IP address instead of your own.

Think of a proxy like a postal forwarding service: instead of sending mail directly from your home address, you send it through a forwarding service that uses their address. The recipient sees the forwarding service's address, not yours.

## Popular Use Cases
