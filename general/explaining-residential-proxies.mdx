Residential proxies are proxy servers that use real residential IP addresses. Unlike other proxy types that rely on datacenters or servers, residential proxies route traffic through devices of users in residential areas. This changes your own IP address to a residential IP address in a different location.

## Why Use Residential Proxies?

With residential proxies, websites can't easily detect that your traffic is coming from a proxy. Since many websites and services tend to ban IPs that are identifiable as proxies, using a residential proxy is the most effective way to avoid such restrictions.

  - Higher success rates on restrictive websites
  - More natural browsing patterns
  - Access to geo-restricted content
  - Lower detection rates
  - Wide range of locations

## How Residential Proxies Are Charged

Residential proxies at Ping Proxies use a **Pay per GB model**. Charges are based on the amount of data (bandwidth) transferred through the proxy service.

<Note>
This is similar to how mobile phone plans charge for data usage - you pay for what you consume. For instance, just as you might pay for 5GB of mobile phone data per month, you could pay for 5GB of proxy bandwidth.
</Note>

This model is particularly beneficial for users who need access to a wide range of IP addresses across various regions but may not have consistent or high-volume usage.

## Unlimited Proxy Generation

Yes! We have no limitations on proxies or concurrency with our residential bandwidth packages since they're charged per GB.

This means you can generate millions of different proxies and use them concurrently without worrying about rate-limiting. Your only constraint is the amount of bandwidth in your account.

## Geographic Coverage

We support over 195 countries and every major city in the world on all residential bandwidth plans. After purchase, you can select the country or city you'd like to geolocate your proxies to.

<Warning>
Increasing the precision of proxy geolocation reduces the number of available proxies. We generally recommend using country-level geolocation, unless you specifically need city-based proxies. This approach provides a good balance between location accuracy and proxy pool size.
</Warning>

## Carrier and ASN Targeting

Yes! All plans come with carrier and ASN targeting as standard and you can select from over 10,000 networks and ASNs.

We offer proxies from all major carriers including:
- China Mobile
- Reliance Jio
- Vodafone Group
- Bharti Airtel
- Verizon
- AT&T
- Deutsche Telekom
- T-Mobile US
- And hundreds more

<Tip>
Limiting the ASN of your proxies reduces the number of available proxies. Unless you specifically need proxies from a specific carrier, we generally recommend leaving this feature off.
</Tip>

## Ethical Sourcing

Yes! Ping Proxies partners with SDK programs and peer payment applications which compensate developers and end-users for their participation in our network.

These programs pay regular internet users to share their traffic and become a part of a proxy network. This way, users are fairly compensated and are always well-informed about how their IP addresses might be used.

<Card title="Ethical Commitment" icon="shield-check">
On top of that, Ping Proxies has a strict [Acceptable Usage Policy](/general/acceptable-usage-policy) which helps ensure that users don't misuse the proxy. This protects everyone within the proxy network and minimizes the amount of shady or illegal activities.
