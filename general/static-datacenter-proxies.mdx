## What is a Datacenter Proxy?

A datacenter proxy is a type of proxy server that provides an IP address from a datacenter rather than one linked to an internet service provider (ISP). Like all proxy types, datacenter proxies:

- Hide your real IP address
- Change your digital location
- Route your traffic through an intermediary server before it reaches the internet

## Key Characteristics

Datacenter proxies are hosted in commercial datacenters and have several distinctive features:

- **High Speed**: Typically offer the fastest connection speeds among proxy types
- **Unlimited Bandwidth**: No data transfer limitations
- **Stability**: Highly reliable connections with minimal downtime
- **Cost-Effective**: Generally less expensive than residential or ISP proxies
- **Datacenter ASN**: Use IP addresses with Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) from datacenter networks

## Benefits and Use Cases

Datacenter proxies excel in many scenarios:

- **Web Scraping**: Perfect for high-volume data collection projects
- **Market Research**: Gather competitive intelligence efficiently
- **SEO Monitoring**: Track search rankings across different locations
- **Automation**: Support bots and automated tasks with reliable connections
- **Load Testing**: Test website performance under various conditions

## Limitations

While powerful, datacenter proxies do have some limitations to consider:

- **Detection Risk**: Some websites can detect and block datacenter IPs
- **Less Legitimacy**: Don't appear as regular consumer connections
- **Geographic Precision**: Less accurate geo-targeting than residential proxies

## Unlimited Concurrency and Bandwidth

Our datacenter proxies include:

- **No Bandwidth Limits**: Transfer as much data as needed
- **Unlimited Threads**: Run multiple concurrent connections
