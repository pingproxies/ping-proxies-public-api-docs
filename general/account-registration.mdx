# Account Registration

Before you can purchase proxies or use the Ping Proxies API, you'll need to create and verify an account.

## Registration Options

Ping Proxies offers two convenient ways to register for an account:

### Standard Email Registration

1. Visit our [sign-up page](https://dashboard.pingproxies.com/sign-up)
2. Enter your email address and create a password
3. Check your inbox for a verification email from `security.noreply@pingproxies.com`
4. Enter the two-factor authentication code from the email to verify your account

<Note>
  Each account must have a unique email address. Be sure to check your spam folder if you don't see the verification email in your inbox.
</Note>

### Google Sign-Up (OAuth)

For a faster registration process, you can use your Google account:

1. Click [Sign Up With Google](http://api.pingproxies.com/1.0/private/user/customer/oauth?automatic_redirect=true&external_service=google&authorization_type=signup&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdashboard.pingproxies.com)
2. Follow the Google authentication prompts
3. Grant permission for Ping Proxies to access your Google account information

When using Google sign-up, authentication is handled through OAuth, and we rely on Google to verify your identity. This method bypasses the need for email verification.

## Account Security

We take security seriously and implement several measures to protect your account:

- **Email Verification**: Confirms ownership of your email address
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Available for additional account security
- **Secure OAuth Integration**: When using Google sign-up

After successfully registering your account, you'll have immediate access to the Ping Proxies dashboard where you can:

- Browse available proxy products
- Make purchases
- Generate API keys
- Manage your proxy infrastructure

## Next Steps

Once your account is created, you're ready to [make your first purchase](/general/making-your-first-purchase) or explore the dashboard to learn more about our proxy offerings.
