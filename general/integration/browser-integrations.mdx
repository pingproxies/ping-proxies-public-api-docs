All Ping Proxies services can be easily integrated into most internet browsers including Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Brave, and many more.

We currently recommend using FoxyProxy to add proxies to your browser. You can download the extension using the links below:

- [FoxyProxy Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/foxyproxy-standard/gcknhkkoolaabfmlnjonogaaifnjlfnp?hl=en)
- [FoxyProxy Brave](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/foxyproxy-standard/gcknhkkoolaabfmlnjonogaaifnjlfnp?hl=en)
- [FoxyProxy Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/)

## Setup Guides

Choose from our detailed integration guides below. We recommend FoxyProxy for most users, but also provide alternatives like Proxy SwitchyOmega for advanced users. Some browsers like Safari and Microsoft Edge have more limited proxy support or extension availability, so we've created dedicated setup guides for these browsers. For browsers without native proxy support, we recommend using Proxifier as a system-wide proxy solution.
