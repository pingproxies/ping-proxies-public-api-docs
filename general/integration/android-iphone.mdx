Ping Proxies can be used on mobile devices, but native proxy support on both iOS and Android has several limitations that affect compatibility and performance when using authenticated proxies.

## Limitations of Native Proxy Support

Both iOS and Android offer built-in proxy settings under Wi-Fi network configurations. While this allows basic proxy routing, it comes with the following limitations:

- No ability to restrict or route traffic by app
- No visibility into proxy status or traffic logs
- No support for rule-based routing or custom DNS

For this reason, we recommend using third-party proxy clients that are purpose-built for mobile.

## Recommended Apps

### iOS & Android â€” Use Shadowrocket

We recommend using **Shadowrocket**, a powerful proxy client that supports:

- Full authentication (username and password)
- HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS5, and custom rule routing
- Per-domain and per-app rules
- DNS over HTTPS and custom DNS settings
- Detailed logging and connection stats

> ðŸ“˜ To get started, follow our [Shadowrocket Integration Guide](/general/integration/shadowrocket) for a complete walkthrough.

Shadowrocket is a paid app available on the App Store. Once configured, it enables seamless proxy usage across all apps on the device.
