## Editing Process

1. Navigate to the Proxy User management section in your dashboard

3. Click the "Edit" button next to their name
4. Make your desired changes to any of the editable attributes
5. Click "Save" to apply your changes

## Password Requirements

When editing a proxy user's password, remember that it must:
- Be between 8 and 16 characters long
- Contain only alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers)

## Residential Bandwidth Allocation

When adjusting residential bandwidth, you can only increase the allocation - you cannot reduce it below the current usage level. This prevents accidentally restricting access for proxy users who have already consumed bandwidth.

## IP Authentication

IP authentication allows proxy access based on client IP address without sending credentials in each request. You can add up to 3 IP addresses per proxy user for authentication purposes.

## Service Restrictions

You can limit a proxy user's access to specific proxy services by selecting the relevant Service IDs. This is useful for controlling which proxies a particular user can access.
