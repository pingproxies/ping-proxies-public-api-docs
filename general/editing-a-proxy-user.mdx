## Editing Process

1. Navigate to the Proxy User management section in your dashboard
2. Find the proxy user you want to edit
3. Click the "Edit" button next to their name
4. Make your desired changes to any of the editable attributes
5. Click "Save" to apply your changes

## Password Requirements

When editing a proxy user's password, remember that it must:
- Be between 8 and 16 characters long
- Contain only alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers)

## Residential Bandwidth Allocation

When adjusting residential bandwidth, you can only increase the allocation - you cannot reduce it below the current usage level. This prevents accidentally restricting access for proxy users who have already consumed bandwidth.

## IP Authentication

IP authentication allows proxy access based on client IP address without sending credentials in each request. You can add up to 3 IP addresses per proxy user for authentication purposes.

## Access Control

You can control which proxies a proxy user can access using the `proxy_user_access_type` field and Proxy User ACL entries:

- **Unrestricted Access (`"all"`)**: The proxy user can access all proxies in your account
- **Service-Restricted (`"service_restricted"`)**: The proxy user can only access proxies within specific services. Create Proxy User ACL entries to grant access to services.
- **Proxy-Restricted (`"proxy_restricted"`)**: The proxy user can only access specific individual proxies. Create Proxy User ACL entries to grant access to proxies.

Use the Proxy User ACL endpoints to manage which services or proxies a restricted proxy user can access. See the [Proxy User Access Control guide](/api-explainers/proxy-user-access-control) for more details.
