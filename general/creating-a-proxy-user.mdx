## Configuration Options

When the modal opens, you can configure your new proxy user with:

- Custom Proxy User ID and password
- Limited access to residential bandwidth
- Restricted access to specific Static Proxies
- IP Authentication settings to allow access without username/password

## Limitations & Rules

|-------|----------|-------------|

| Proxy User Password | Yes | 8-16 Alphanumeric characters |
| Number of Proxy Users | Contact Support | 3 per Customer |
| Number of IP Authentications | No | 3 per Proxy User |

## Why Create Additional Proxy Users?

Creating additional proxy users allows you to:

- Organize proxies for different projects or teams
- Set different bandwidth limits for various use cases
- Implement more granular access control
- Track usage separately for different applications
