## SOCKS5
SOCKS proxies allow you to tunnel both TCP and UDP traffic, making them a very good choice for things like gaming or VOIP (Voice over IP).

### TCP
### UDP


## HTTP
HTTP proxies can either tunnel TPC traffic, or HTTP request. They do this by using the CONNECT method for  establishing TCP tunnels or acting as a man in the middle, directly forwariding any non-CONNECT requests it receives.

### HTTP/1.1
#### CONNECT
The CONNECT method is very simple. Simply send your tyarget destination and proxy credentials to the proxy server in a request using the CONNECT method. The proxy server will establish a tunnel to that target server, send you a 200 OK telling you the proxy tunnel has been established, then blindly funnel bytes between you and your target.

#### MITM
MITM proxying is even simpler than the CONNECT method. Simply send your request directly to the server and it will forward it for you. Unfortunately, the  simplicity of MITM proxying is offset by security risks as you can no longer perform _TLS to the Target_ to encryp your data  and hide it from anyone listening and even the proxy server itself.


### HTTP/2
HTTP/2 offers many advantages over HTTP/1.1. You can read about (or watch) these advantages in our blog _here_. To summarise however, HTTP/2 lets  you send multiple requests over the same connection, concurrently. Alllowing greater throughput with lower overhead.

You can't just speak HTTP/2 with a server, as not all servers support it. Fortunately, there exist three methods turning a TCP connection into a HTTP/2 connection:

- Prior Knowledge. Just asssume it speaks HTTP/2.
- HTTP/1.1 Ugprade. Speak HTTP/1 to the server and ask it to do HTTP/2.
- ALPN. When doing the TLS handshake, ask the server what protocols it supports.

On our services, we support Prior Knowledge and ALPN. The examples below show how to use both methods.

#### CONNECT
CONNECTs with HTTP/2 work just the same as in HTTP/1.1, except you can send multiple of them over the same connection at the same time.

#### MITM

### HTTP/3
The CONNECT method, even when used with HTTP/3 proxies which operate over UDP and QUIC, still establishes a TCP connection to the target. If you wish to establish a UDP using HTTP/3 "connection" to the target, you need to use the as-yet unsupported (by everyone, everywhere) CONNECT-UDP method. Alternatively, using SOCKS5 UDP.

#### CONNECT
#### MITM

## HTTP/3 over SOCKS5 UDP - Controlling Your Fingerprint
When using a MITM style proxy, the proxy server is responsible for performing the TLS handshake with the target. As such, you end up with a TLS fingerprint (JA3/JA4) that might not be ideal for your use-case. Until the CONNECT-UDP method is added to our network (or other  providers) the best solution is to proxy your HTTP/3 traffic over a SOCKS5 UDP proxy. The example below illustrates how you might do this.
