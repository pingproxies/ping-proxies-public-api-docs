We are committed to maintaining the highest ethical standards and ensuring our services are used responsibly. While we do not require KYC verification for every customer, we have implemented a risk-based approach to customer verification that helps us maintain a secure and compliant network environment.

## When KYC is Required

We regularly monitor network activity and may request KYC verification in the following circumstances:

##### Automatic KYC Requirements
- **All resellers:** Any customer operating as a reseller or redistributor of our services
- **Free trial requests:** Customers requesting access to free trial periods
- **Large usage patterns:** Customers with high bandwidth consumption or extensive proxy usage

##### Risk-Based KYC Triggers
- **Sensitive domain access:** Activity involving domains that are sensitive but not entirely blocked
- **Random compliance checks:** Small, randomly selected customer groups to ensure ongoing compliance and deter bad actors
- **Additional risk factors:** As determined by our automated monitoring systems and risk assessment protocols

## Verification Process

We partner with [**Idenfy**](https://www.idenfy.com/), a trusted identity verification provider, to conduct our KYC processes. This ensures secure, reliable, and compliant customer verification while protecting your personal information.

## Information Required

Our KYC process is designed to be comprehensive yet respectful of your privacy. We may request the following information:

### Company Details
- Registered company name
- Business industry and sector
- Date of incorporation
- Registered company address

### Contact Information
- Primary phone number
- Business email address
- Authorized contact person details

### Usage Information
