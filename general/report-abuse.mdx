## Our Investigation Process

When we receive an abuse report, we log it with a ticket number and acknowledge it within 24 hours. We then identify which service or infrastructure is involved and investigate to verify the activity. If confirmed, we take corrective action directly or require our downstream customers to address it with their end-users. We keep the reporting party updated throughout and confirm when the issue is resolved.

Enforcement depends on severity. Minor issues get warnings. Serious abuse leads to suspension, null-routing, or service termination. Repeat offenders face permanent bans and IP revocation. For illegal content like CSAM, terrorism material, or violent extremism, we restrict services, permanently ban the customer and their fingerprint to prevent re-registration, and reserve the right to contact local law enforcement.

## Law Enforcement & Regulatory Cooperation

We cooperate fully with properly authorized law enforcement requests from United Kingdom authorities and from jurisdictions friendly to the United Kingdom, including the United States, European Union member states, Canada, Australia, and other Five Eyes countries. All requests must meet appropriate legal standards with proper authorization such as court orders, warrants, or requests issued under the UK Investigatory Powers Act 2016.
