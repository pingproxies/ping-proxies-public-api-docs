title: 'Proxy Replacement Policy'
description: 'Understanding our policy for proxy replacements and how to handle replacement events'
---

On rare occasions, we may need to replace proxies due to force majeure events such as:

- Subnet lease recalls
- Extended network disruptions in specific locations
- Other circumstances deemed necessary by Ping Technology Labs LTD

We strive to minimize any inconvenience caused by such replacements and will work to ensure continued service quality.

When a replacement occurs, you will:

1. Receive electronic communication about the replacement event
2. Be able to view the replacements via the Replacements page in the dashboard

## Viewing Your Replacements

The Replacements page in your dashboard provides:

- A complete history of all proxy replacements
- Details about which proxies were replaced
- The reason for each replacement
- The status of each replacement
- Export functionality for your new proxies

## Replacement Requests

We do not offer in-term proxy replacements as a standard policy. 

However, we may consider exceptions in the following cases:

- You have just renewed your proxies
- You purchased a service within the last four hours

If either of these situations applies to you and you would like to replace or change some of your proxies, please:

- Contact [support@pingproxies.com](mailto:support@pingproxies.com)
- Open a support ticket via the dashboard

<Note>
  All replacement requests are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. We cannot guarantee approval of replacement requests that fall outside our standard policy.
</Note>

## Best Practices

When a replacement occurs:

1. Update your systems with the new proxy information as soon as possible
2. Test the new proxies to ensure they meet your requirements
3. Discontinue use of the old proxies, as they may no longer function correctly
4. Contact support if you experience any issues with your replacement proxies
