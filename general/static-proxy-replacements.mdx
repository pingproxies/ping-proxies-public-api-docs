title: 'Proxy Replacement Policy'
description: 'Understanding our policy for proxy replacements and how to handle replacement events'
---

This page applies to static proxy services such as Static Residential ISP Proxies and Static Datacenter Proxies. These services are sold on a per-IP address basis and may occasionally require replacements or IP address updates.
## Our Philosophy

We are not a rapid turnover service that facilitates frequent proxy changes. Instead, we focus on providing stable, high-quality proxy services for long-term, ethical use cases. We expect our customers to use proxies responsibly and maintain them for their intended duration. This approach allows us to deliver consistent performance and build lasting partnerships with clients who value reliability over constant turnover.

## Standard Replacement Policy

**We do not offer in-term proxy replacements as a standard policy.** This ensures service stability and maintains the integrity of our IP allocation system.

### Exception Cases

We may consider replacement requests in limited circumstances:

- **Recent renewals**: You have just renewed your proxy service
- **New purchases**: You purchased proxies within the last four hours

### How to Request a Replacement

If you meet the exception criteria above and need to replace proxies:

1. **Email**: Contact [support@pingproxies.com](mailto:support@pingproxies.com)
2. **Dashboard**: Open a support ticket through your account dashboard

<Note>
  All replacement requests undergo case-by-case review. Approval is not guaranteed for requests outside our standard policy exceptions.
</Note>

## Mandatory Replacements

In rare circumstances, we may need to replace proxies due to events beyond our control, including:

- **Subnet lease recalls** from upstream providers
- **Extended network disruptions** in specific geographic locations  
- **Force majeure events** or other circumstances deemed necessary by Ping Technology Labs LTD

**Our commitment**: We work diligently to minimize service disruptions and maintain consistent proxy quality. Mandatory replacements are uncommon occurrences.

### What Happens During a Replacement

When we initiate a mandatory replacement:

1. **Notification**: You'll receive immediate electronic communication about the replacement
2. **Dashboard access**: View detailed replacement information via the Replacements page
3. **Service continuity**: We ensure minimal downtime during the transition process

## Managing Your Replacements

### Accessing the Replacements Dashboard

The Replacements page in your dashboard provides comprehensive tracking:

- **Complete replacement history** for your account
- **Detailed logs** showing which specific proxies were replaced
- **Replacement reasons** and status updates for each event
- **Export functionality** to download your new proxy configurations

### Best Practices for Replacement Events

Follow these steps when a replacement occurs:

1. **Update immediately**: Integrate new proxy information into your systems as soon as possible
2. **Test thoroughly**: Verify that replacement proxies meet your performance requirements  
3. **Discontinue old proxies**: Stop using replaced IP addresses, as they will no longer function
4. **Monitor performance**: Ensure new proxies maintain expected connection quality
5. **Contact support**: Reach out immediately if you experience any issues with replacement proxies
