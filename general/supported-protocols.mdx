# Supported Protocols

All proxy services from Ping Proxies support multiple connection protocols to ensure compatibility with a wide range of applications and use cases.

## Protocol Support Matrix

The table below details the protocol support across our various proxy services:

| Service Type | HTTP/S | SOCKS5 TCP | SOCKS5 UDP |
|--------------|--------|------------|------------|
| Datacenter Proxies | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Static Residential Proxies | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Residential Bandwidth | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

## HTTP/S Support

Our proxies support HTTP and HTTPS connections, including SSL targets via CONNECT tunneling. This ensures that you can securely access encrypted websites and services through our proxy network.

## SOCKS5 TCP Support

All of our proxy services support SOCKS5 TCP connections, providing a versatile option for applications that require this protocol. SOCKS5 offers advantages for certain use cases where HTTP proxying might be insufficient.

## Protocol Selection

When connecting to our proxies, you can choose the protocol that best fits your needs:

- Use **HTTP/S** for web browsing, data collection, and most general use cases
- Use **SOCKS5 TCP** for applications that require TCP protocol support beyond HTTP

## Configuring Your Connection

The specific port you connect to will determine which protocol is used. Please refer to your proxy credentials for the correct port numbers for each protocol type.

<Note>
  While we support SOCKS5 TCP, we do not currently support SOCKS5 UDP connections. Applications requiring UDP protocol support may not function properly through our proxies.
