All proxy services from Ping Proxies support multiple protocols on the same port to ensure compatibility and ease of use with a wide range of applications.

## Protocol Support Matrix
The table below details the protocol support across our various proxy services:

| Service Type | HTTP/S | SOCKS5 TCP | SOCKS5 UDP |
|--------------|--------|------------|------------|
| Datacenter Proxies | ✅ | ✅ | Coming Soon |
| Static Residential Proxies | ✅ | ✅ | Coming Soon |
| Residential Bandwidth | ✅ | ✅ | Coming Soon |


The tables in the sectionsbelow details TLS and specific protocol verion support across each of these product lines.
### Datacenter and ISP
| Protocol | Supported | Cleartext to Proxy | Encrypted to Proxy |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| SOCKS5  | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| HTTP/1  | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| HTTP/2  | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| HTTP/2  | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |


Our Datacenter and ISP proxies support SOCKS5, HTTP/1 and HTTP/2. We do not provide IP based TLS certificates so all communication with the proxy must be cleartext. This DOES NOT mean your traffic is unencrypted. You will still do TLS to the target as long as your target supports TLS.

<Note>
For HTTP/2, these product ranges only support the HTTP/2 Prior Knowledge.
</Note>

### Residential
| Protocol | Supported | Cleartext to Proxy | Encrypted to Proxy |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| SOCKS5  | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| HTTP/1  | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| HTTP/2  | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| HTTP/3  | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |

Our Residential proxies  support SOCKS5, HTTP/1, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. We provide TLS certificates for our residential backconnects so all communication with the proxy can be encrypted - inlucding SOCKS5 if you so desire. Unlike competitors we support HTTP upgrades via ALPN. Simply set your proxy string to use the "HTTPS" scheme and your client will do the rest of the work, upgrading you to the best protocol for the job under the hood.

<Note>
For HTTP/2, we support Prior Knowledge and ALPN upgrades. We do not support HTTP/1 upgrades to HTTP/2 for security reasons.
</Note>

<Note>
  We do not support HTTP targets on our residential network to protect user security. You must ensure you are connecting to HTTPS targets via port 443.
</Note>


## HTTP/S Support
Our proxies support the tunneling of HTTPS connections. HTTP proxy connections tunnel HTTPS connections to SSL targets via CONNECT tunneling and

HTTPS to the Proxy means that whentalking to our server to begin proxying, information such as your target website and your authentication credentials are encrypted. To do HTTPS to the Proxy, simply set "HTTPS" as the scheme in your proxy string (see tables  above for product support).

HTTPS to the Target means that when talking to your end website ("https://www.pingproxies.com" for example), all data is encrypted and unreadable to anyone but you. This inlcudes us, we cannot see what you are doing either. To do HTTPS to the Target, simply set the scheme of your desired website to "HTTPS".

To be clear, unencrypted connections to the proxy can still do encrypted connections to SSL targets via CONNECT tunneling your data remains encrypted as bytes are tunneled from client to target server, and vice-versa. This ensures that you can securely access encrypted websites and services through our proxy network.

## HTTP Method Support
All of our HTTP capable protocols - regardless of version - support two methods of usage.

- Firstly, with the CONNECT method which establishes a TCP tunnel to your target.
- Secondly as a man in the middle (MITM) proxy, which reads your requests and forwards them  to your target.

CONNECT tunnels should be used in the majority of cases but especially when connecting to a TLS capable target. Any TCP based protocol can be spoken over a CONNECT tunnel, you aren't  limited to HTTP traffic only. As mentioned above, we can't see any of your traffic when  using a CONNECT tunnel to a TLS capable endpoint.

When acting as a MITM, your requests are forwarded with minimal changes (we strip proxy specific headers). MITM proxies can be used to send requests to hboth cleartext and TLS capable endpoints. When communicating with a TLS capable endpoint and using as a MITM proxy, we can see the contents of your requests. If you do not desire this, use a CONNECT tunnel.

Typical proxy clients follow this simple rule: HTTPS requests go through a CONNECT tunnel, HTTP requests are sent MITM-style. We supoprt other use-cases  so that when writing your own clients, we can fit any use-case.

<Note>
When acting as a MITM proxy, requests sent to TLS capable endpoints might be modified for compatability with the target. If you send us HTTP/2 but the target only supports HTTP/1, we will adjust the protocol version.
</Note>

## SOCKS5 TCP Support
All of our proxy services support SOCKS5 TCP connections, providing a versatile option for applications that require this protocol. SOCKS5 offers advantages for certain use cases where HTTP proxying might be insufficient.

## Protocol Selection
When connecting to our proxies, you can choose the protocol that best fits your needs:

- Use *HTTP/S* for web browsing, data collection, and most general use cases
- Use *SOCKS5 TCP* for applications that require TCP protocol support beyond HTTP


## Code Examples
### SOCKS5
### SOCKS5 UDP

### HTTP/1.1 CONNECT
### HTTP/1.1 MITM
### HTTP/2 CONNECT
### HTTP/2 MITM
### HTTP/3 CONNECT
### HTTP/3 MITM
