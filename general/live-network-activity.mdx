## Why use Live Network Activity?

Historically, proxy debugging has required combing through delayed logs, third-party monitoring tools, and disconnected status systems. The [Live Network Activity viewer](https://dashboard.pingproxies.com/observability/live) solves this by delivering all traffic-level insight in one place—updated in real time and tied directly to your usage.

This tool is essential for:

- Debugging failed or misrouted proxy requests
- Monitoring performance of specific hosts or applications
- Validating user-specific traffic behavior
- Troubleshooting internal service or network routing issues

## Core Capabilities

### Real-Time Request Monitoring

All proxy requests are streamed live and displayed as they happen. The table updates automatically and reflects:

- Request timestamps
- Byte counts
- Duration in milliseconds
- Target domains
- Proxy user and proxy ID
- Network type and IP addresses

You can observe immediate feedback from your requests without needing to reload the page or rely on static exports.

### Internal Error Codes

Due to TLS encryption, we do not display HTTP status codes. Instead, Ping Proxies uses internal error codes that represent issues encountered during the connection or transmission phases.

These may include:

- DNS resolution failures
- TLS negotiation errors
- Target unreachable
- Timeout or socket closure issues

Each error code is accompanied by a user-friendly description. For a complete list, refer to our [Live Network Error Codes documentation](/docs/errors#live-network-errors).

### Flexible Filtering System

The **Add Filter** menu allows you to combine multiple filters to isolate specific events or troubleshoot traffic segments.

Available filters include:

- Log ID
- Network
- Protocol
- Error Code
- Bytes
- Duration
- Proxy User
- Client IP Address
- Proxy ID
- Proxy IP Address
- Service ID

Filters support chaining and are dynamically applied, letting you narrow down from thousands of requests to just a few relevant entries in seconds.

## Getting Started

Live Network Activity is available under the **Network Observability** section in your dashboard. It requires no setup—logging is automatic for all proxy requests made through your account.

To start:

1. Go to `Network Observability` → [Live Activity](https://dashboard.pingproxies.com/observability/live)
2. Use the filter menu to customize your view
3. Observe request activity in real time

The viewer is optimized for performance and can handle high request volumes without delay, even in enterprise-scale environments.

## Use Cases

Live Network Activity is especially useful for:

- **Technical debugging** of failed requests or slow responses
- **Traffic pattern inspection** for monitoring uptime and volume
- **Operational audits** tied to specific proxy users, networks, or service IDs
- **Performance monitoring** for latency or timeout detection
