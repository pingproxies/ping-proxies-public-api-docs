Ping Proxies supports multiple authentication methods to provide flexible, secure access to your proxies. Our innovative [Proxy User and IAM system](https://dashboard.pingproxies.com/proxy-users) lets you create and manage proxy users, track their usage, limit residential bandwidth, and link their access to specific proxies and servicesâ€”all from our dashboard.

## Authentication Methods

### Proxy User Authentication

This authentication type allows you to create a Proxy User and access all available proxies using their username and password credentials.

- **Benefits**: Use consistent credentials across all your proxies
- **Recommended for**: Resellers who want to assign each customer a dedicated proxy user with access to specific services

### IP Authentication

With IP authentication, you can access your static proxies without entering username and password credentials. This method works by:

1. Creating a proxy user
2. Attaching a whitelisted IP address to that user for authentication

**Important**: Each whitelisted IP address must be unique and cannot be assigned to multiple proxy users.

<Warning>

IP Authentication is not available on our rotating residential bandwidth network since the username parameters are used to inter targeting and geolocation settings.

</Warning>

### Proxy Specific Authentication

This method restricts access to a single static proxy by assigning unique credentials that work only with that specific proxy.

- **Limitation**: Credentials cannot be used to access other proxies, even within the same service
- **Analytics**: When using proxy-specific authentication, all analytics and usage will be attributed to your default account Proxy User

## Choosing the Right Authentication Method

- **For resellers**: Proxy User Authentication provides the best control and tracking
- **For server applications**: IP Authentication eliminates the need to store credentials
- **For specialized access control**: Proxy Specific Authentication offers the most granular security

All authentication methods can be managed through our dashboard or programmatically via our API.
