We support basic Two-factor Authentication (2FA) via email and plan to add further 2FA support in the future.

Your Two-factor Authentication (2FA) status can be managed in your Account Security section of the dashboard.

## Enabling Two-factor Authentication (2FA)

1. Click **Turn on two-factor authentication**

2. A pop-up will appear and an email will be sent to you with a code confirming you have access to your account email address.

3. Enter the code and click **Confirm**

4. Your account is now Two-factor Authentication (2FA) protected and all logins will require a 2FA code in the future.
