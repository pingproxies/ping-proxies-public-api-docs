## Edit Options

There are two main options when editing your subscription billing information.

### Automatic Renewal

This controls whether your payment card will be automatically charged and the subscription extended. If you pay via cryptocurrency or other methods such as store credit, then this will be set to No.

### Payment Card

This controls the payment card that an subscription will create an automatic charge from. Payment card can only be selected when Automatic Renewal is set to Yes.
