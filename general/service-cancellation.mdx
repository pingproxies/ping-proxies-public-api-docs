## Cancellation

Once clicked, a pop-up will appear and it will allow you to cancel your subscription and service.

You'll be able to leave us feedback on the reason you are cancelling - we really appreciate any and all feedback as it helps us improve our services.

If you have a Datacenter or Static Residential Proxies service then your proxies will be be lost instantly after confirming the cancellation and you will not be refunded unless customer support has specifically stated prior.

If you are using residential bandwidth, cancelling a subscription and service will not effect your existing residential bandwidth. This bandwidth will remain on your account for your use in the future.

## Pause rather than cancel

Residential subscriptions can be easily and indefinitely paused rather than cancelled. This allows you to maintain the same service but take a break if you don't need anymore bandwidth.

While the service is paused, all invoices will be voided and you won't be charged or credited new bandwidth until the subscription is unpaused.

Pausing is not available to Static Residential or Datacenter Proxies.
