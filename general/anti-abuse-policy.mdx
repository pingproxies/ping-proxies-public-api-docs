title: 'Fair Usage Policy'
description: 'Understanding the bandwidth and connection limits for static proxy services'
---

Our Dedicated Static Residential ISP Proxies and Datacenter Proxies operate under a fair usage policy to ensure optimal performance and availability for all customers.

## Bandwidth Limits

While we advertise unlimited bandwidth for our static proxy services, we define reasonable usage parameters:

- **Standard Limit**: Up to 18TB per 500 proxies per monthly subscription cycle
- **Prorated Scaling**: Limits are proportionally adjusted based on your subscription quantity and billing cycle
- **Dynamic Enforcement**: These limits may fluctuate based on current network conditions, usage patterns, and available capacity

## Connection Limits

To maintain service quality and prevent abuse, we implement concurrent connection limitations:

- **Standard Threshold**: Up to 100 concurrent connections per proxy
- **Adaptive Restrictions**: Additional limitations may be imposed based on:
  - Current network conditions
  - Overall usage patterns
  - Suspicious activities
  - Target websites being accessed

<Note>
  Connection limits are primarily designed to prevent service abuse while allowing legitimate use cases to operate without disruption.
</Note>

## Policy Enforcement

We reserve the right to modify usage parameters without prior notice in cases of:

- Excessive traffic volume
- Access to suspicious targets
- Patterns indicating potential abuse
- Activities violating our Terms of Service

This policy applies to both new and existing users with active subscriptions.

## Requesting Increased Limits

If your use case requires higher bandwidth or connection limits:

1. Contact us at [support@pingproxies.com](mailto:support@pingproxies.com)
2. Provide details about your specific requirements
3. Our team will review your request on a case-by-case basis

<Warning>
  Unauthorized attempts to circumvent our fair usage limitations may result in service restrictions or account suspension.
</Warning>

## Our Commitment

Our goal is to ensure fair usage and maintain service quality for all customers while allowing flexible and robust proxy usage within reasonable limits. We continually monitor and adjust our infrastructure to maximize performance and availability for legitimate use cases.
