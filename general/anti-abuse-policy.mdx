title: 'Fair Usage Policy'
description: 'Understanding our flexible approach to bandwidth and connection management'
---

Our Fair Usage Policy is designed to protect our network and ensure excellent performance for all customers. **These guidelines are rarely enforced** and exist primarily to help us identify and address extreme abuse cases that could impact service quality for other users.

## Our Philosophy

We believe in providing generous, flexible proxy services. These policies are safety nets that allow us to take action only when customers engage in obviously abusive behavior at levels similar to DDoS or DoS attacks that negatively affect our network and other customers' experience.

## Bandwidth Guidelines

Our static proxy services come with generous bandwidth allowances designed to accommodate most legitimate use cases:

- **Generous Standard Allowance**: Up to 100TB per 500 proxies per monthly billing cycle
- **Proportional Scaling**: Limits scale with your subscription size and billing frequency
- **Flexible Implementation**: We adjust these thresholds based on network capacity and overall health

<Note>
  The vast majority of our customers never approach these limits. They're primarily in place to identify extreme usage patterns that could indicate network abuse.
</Note>

## Connection Management

We maintain reasonable connection limits to ensure network stability:

- **Comfortable Concurrent Limits**: Up to several hundred simultaneous connections per proxy
- **Intelligent Monitoring**: We may apply additional safeguards during:
  - High network load periods
  - Suspicious traffic patterns
  - Activities that resemble automated attacks
  - Unusual target access patterns

## When We Take Action

**These policies are almost never enforced** for typical usage. We only intervene in clear cases of abuse such as:

- Traffic volumes approaching DDoS/DoS attack levels
- Patterns that significantly degrade service for other customers
- Activities that threaten network infrastructure stability
- Clear violations of our Terms of Service

Our approach is always to contact customers first to understand their use case before taking any restrictive action.

## Need Higher Limits?

If your legitimate business needs exceed our standard guidelines, we're happy to work with you:

1. **Reach out early**: Contact [support@pingproxies.com](mailto:support@pingproxies.com)
2. **Explain your use case**: Help us understand your requirements
3. **Custom solutions**: We often accommodate higher limits for genuine business needs

## Our Promise

We're committed to providing robust, reliable proxy services without unnecessary restrictions. These policies exist to protect our network infrastructure and ensure consistent performance for all customers, not to limit legitimate business activities.

<Warning>
  While we rarely enforce these limits, attempting to deliberately circumvent our network protections or engage in obviously abusive behavior may result in service restrictions.
</Warning>

**Bottom line**: Use our services for legitimate purposes, and you'll likely never encounter these limitations. We're here to support your success, not create barriers.
