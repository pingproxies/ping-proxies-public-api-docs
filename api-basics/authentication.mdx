# Authentication

The Ping Proxies API uses API keys for authentication. Every request to the API must include authentication credentials to verify your identity and access rights.

## API Keys

Authentication is performed using a pair of API keys:

1. **Public API Key**: Identifies your account but isn't considered secret
2. **Private API Key**: Secret key that should never be shared or exposed

Both keys must be included in every API request.

## Obtaining API Keys

To get your API keys:

1. Log in to the [Ping Proxies Dashboard](https://dashboard.pingproxies.com)
2. Navigate to the **API Keys** section
3. Generate a new API key pair if you don't already have one

<Warning>
  Your Private API Key will only be shown once when generated. Make sure to store it securely.
</Warning>

## Authentication Headers

Include your API keys in the HTTP headers of every request:

```
X-API-Public-Key: your_public_key
X-API-Private-Key: your_private_key
```

Example cURL request with authentication:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.pingproxies.com/1.0/public/user/proxy/search' \
  --header 'X-API-Public-Key: pub_key_aB12cD34eF56gH78' \
  --header 'X-API-Private-Key: priv_key_iJ90kL12mN34oP56'
```

## API Key Security

Protect your API keys using these best practices:

1. **Never expose your Private API Key** in client-side code, public repositories, or to end users
2. **Use environment variables** to store API keys in your applications
3. **Implement IP restrictions** when possible to limit API access to known servers
4. **Rotate keys periodically**, especially after team member changes
5. **Use separate keys** for different environments (development, staging, production)

<Note>
  If you believe your API keys have been compromised, regenerate them immediately from the dashboard.
</Note>

## Authentication Errors

If there are issues with your authentication, you'll receive one of these error responses:

### Missing API Keys

```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "API key authentication is required.",
  "api_request_id": "0a5a76aa-e286-477b-b88f-e5b492a0ba70"
}
```

### Invalid API Keys

```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "Invalid API key combination.",
  "api_request_id": "0a5a76aa-e286-477b-b88f-e5b492a0ba70"
}
```

### Insufficient Permissions

```json
{
  "error": "Forbidden",
  "message": "You don't have permission to access this resource.",
  "api_request_id": "0a5a76aa-e286-477b-b88f-e5b492a0ba70"
}
```

## Two-Factor Authentication

Some sensitive operations in the API require two-factor authentication (2FA). When 2FA is required, you'll receive a `403 Forbidden` response with a special format:

```json
{
  "error": "Two-Factor Authentication Required",
  "message": "This action requires Two-Factor Authentication. Please retry request with Two-Factor Authentication keys.",
  "two_factor_authentication_public_key": "1234567890",
  "two_factor_authentication_service": "email",
  "two_factor_authentication_target": "e******@example.com"
}
```

To complete the request:

1. Retrieve the 2FA code sent to your configured authentication method (email, SMS, etc.)
2. Add the following headers to your original request:
   ```
   X-Two-Factor-Authentication-Public-Key: 1234567890
   X-Two-Factor-Authentication-Private-Key: the_code_you_received
   ```
3. Resend the request with all original parameters and the added 2FA headers

## Access Control

The Ping Proxies API implements resource-based access control:

- You can only access resources associated with your account
- API keys have permissions that may limit which endpoints they can access
- Some operations may require specific subscription levels or additional permissions

## Rate Limiting

Authentication is tied to rate limiting. Each API key pair has its own rate limits:

- 100 requests per minute
- 5,000 requests per day

These limits help ensure fair usage of the API for all users.
