# Error Handling

The Ping Proxies API uses standard HTTP status codes and consistent error response formats to help you identify and resolve issues with your API requests.

## Error Response Format

All API errors follow a consistent JSON format:

```json
{
  "error": "Error Type",
  "message": "Human-readable error description",
  "api_request_id": "0a5a76aa-e286-477b-b88f-e5b492a0ba70"
}
```

### Error Response Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `error` | A short string identifying the error type |
| `message` | A human-readable description of what went wrong |
| `api_request_id` | A unique identifier for the request that can be used when contacting support |

## HTTP Status Codes

The API uses the following HTTP status codes for error responses:

| Status Code | Error Type | Description |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| 400 | Bad Request | The request was invalid or improperly formatted |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Authentication credentials were missing or invalid |
| 403 | Forbidden | Authentication succeeded but you don't have permission |
| 404 | Not Found | The requested resource doesn't exist |
| 409 | Conflict | The request conflicts with the current state |
| 422 | Unprocessable Entity | The request was well-formed but couldn't be processed |
| 429 | Too Many Requests | You've exceeded the rate limit |
| 500 | Internal Server Error | Something went wrong on our servers |

## Common Error Types

### Authentication Errors (401)

```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "API key authentication is required.",
  "api_request_id": "0a5a76aa-e286-477b-b88f-e5b492a0ba70"
}
```

### Permission Errors (403)

```json
{
  "error": "Forbidden",
  "message": "You don't have permission to access this resource.",

}
```

### Resource Not Found (404)

```json

  "error": "Not Found",
  "message": "The requested proxy could not be found.",
  "api_request_id": "0a5a76aa-e286-477b-b88f-e5b492a0ba70"
}
```

### Validation Errors (400)

  "api_request_id": "0a5a76aa-e286-477b-b88f-e5b492a0ba70"
}
```

### Conflict Errors (409)

```json
{
  "error": "Conflict",
  "message": "A proxy user with this ID already exists.",
  "api_request_id": "0a5a76aa-e286-477b-b88f-e5b492a0ba70"
}
```

### Business Logic Errors (422)

```json
{
  "error": "Unprocessable",
  "message": "This service cannot be canceled before the minimum contract period.",
  "api_request_id": "0a5a76aa-e286-477b-b88f-e5b492a0ba70"
}
```

### Rate Limit Errors (429)

```json
{
  "error": "Too Many Requests",
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Please try again in 45 seconds.",
  "api_request_id": "0a5a76aa-e286-477b-b88f-e5b492a0ba70"
}
```

### Server Errors (500)

```json
{
  "error": "Internal Server Error",
  "message": "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.",
  "api_request_id": "0a5a76aa-e286-477b-b88f-e5b492a0ba70"
}
```

## Error Handling Best Practices

### 1. Check HTTP Status Codes

Always check the HTTP status code first to understand the general category of error:
- 4xx errors indicate client-side issues (your request)
- 5xx errors indicate server-side issues (our systems)

### 2. Parse Error Messages

Error messages provide specific information about what went wrong. Parse them to:
- Display to users when appropriate
- Log for debugging
- Handle programmatically

### 3. Implement Retry Logic

Implement retry logic for transient errors:
- 429 (Rate Limit) - Wait and retry after the specified time
- 500, 502, 503, 504 - Retry with exponential backoff

```javascript
// Example exponential backoff retry in JavaScript
async function fetchWithRetry(url, options, maxRetries = 3) {
  let retries = 0;
  
  while (retries < maxRetries) {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(url, options);
      
      // Handle rate limiting
      if (response.status === 429) {
        const retryAfter = response.headers.get('Retry-After') || 5;
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, retryAfter * 1000));
        retries++;
        continue;
      }
      
      // Handle server errors
      if (response.status >= 500) {
        const backoff = Math.pow(2, retries) * 1000;
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, backoff));
        retries++;
        continue;
      }
      
      return response;
    } catch (error) {
      const backoff = Math.pow(2, retries) * 1000;
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, backoff));
      retries++;
      
      if (retries === maxRetries) {
        throw error;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Include Request ID in Support Inquiries

Always include the `api_request_id` when contacting support about an API error. This helps us quickly locate the specific request in our logs.

### 5. Validate Input Before Sending

To avoid 400 errors, validate input on the client side before sending requests:
- Check required fields
- Validate field formats
- Ensure values are within acceptable ranges

### 6. Handle Error States in Your UI

Design your application to handle error states gracefully:
- Show user-friendly error messages
- Provide actionable steps to resolve issues
- Maintain application state during transient errors

## Common Error Scenarios and Solutions

| Error | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| "API key authentication is required" | Missing API key headers | Include both X-API-Public-Key and X-API-Private-Key headers |
| "Invalid API key combination" | Incorrect API keys | Verify your API keys are correct and active |
| "Rate limit exceeded" | Too many requests | Implement rate limiting on your side with proper backoff |
| "The requested resource could not be found" | Invalid ID or wrong endpoint | Check the ID and ensure you're using the correct endpoint |
| "Validation failed" | Invalid input data | Review the error message for specific field issues |
| "This action requires Two-Factor Authentication" | 2FA required for sensitive operation | Implement the 2FA flow in your application |

## Debugging Tips

1. **Enable verbose logging**: Log complete request and response details during development
2. **Check request headers**: Verify all required headers are present and formatted correctly
3. **Validate request bodies**: Ensure JSON is well-formed and contains all required fields
4. **Review API documentation**: Confirm endpoint paths and parameter requirements
5. **Test with curl**: Use curl to isolate API issues from your application code

```bash
curl -v --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.pingproxies.com/1.0/public/user/proxy/search' \
  --header 'X-API-Public-Key: your_public_key' \
  --header 'X-API-Private-Key: your_private_key'
```

By following these error handling best practices, you can build robust applications that gracefully manage API errors and provide a better experience for your users.
