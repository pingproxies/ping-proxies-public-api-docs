To ensure fair usage and system stability, the Ping Proxies API implements rate limiting. This page explains our rate limits and how to work with them effectively.

## Rate Limit Policy

The Ping Proxies API enforces a default rate limit of **10 requests per second** per API key. This applies to most endpoints, with some exceptions:

- Some resource-intensive endpoints may have lower rate limits
- The same limits apply in both testing and production environments

Rate limiting helps us:
- Protect the API from excessive traffic
- Ensure fair access for all users
- Maintain reliable service performance

## Rate Limit Exceeded Response

If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response with a body like:

```json
{
  "error": "Too Many Requests",
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Please try again later.",
  "api_request_id": "0a5a76aa-e286-477b-b88f-e5b492a0ba70"
}
```
