Ping Proxies offers three different authentication methods for accessing your proxies. Our authentication system is designed to provide flexible, secure options that adapt to your specific needs and infrastructure requirements. The main methods include username/password authentication and IP authentication (both part of our Proxy User system), as well as proxy-specific authentication for specialized use cases. Each method has distinct advantages and is suited for different scenarios.

### 1. Proxy User Authentication System

#### 1A. Username/Password Authentication

The standard and recommended authentication method using username/password credentials attached to a Proxy User.

- Works with all proxy types (Datacenter, ISP, Residential)
- Provides full user-level analytics and tracking
- Allows for bandwidth limits and service restrictions
- Simplifies management across your entire proxy infrastructure

<Tip>
  We recommend using Proxy User Authentication for most use cases as it provides the best balance of security, flexibility, and analytics capabilities.

#### 1B. IP Authentication

Authenticate based on your server's IP address without sending credentials in each request. Works with Proxy User system.

```bash
# Add your server's IP to the allowed IPs list
curl --request PATCH \
  --url 'https://api.pingproxies.com/1.0/public/user/proxy_user/edit/your_proxy_user_id' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'X-API-Public-Key: your_public_key' \
  --header 'X-API-Private-Key: your_private_key' \
  --data '{
    "ip_address_authentications": ["203.0.113.1", "198.51.100.2"]
  }'
```

### 2. Proxy-Specific Authentication

Set unique credentials for individual proxies.

```bash
# Set specific credentials for a proxy
curl --request PATCH \
  --url 'https://api.pingproxies.com/1.0/public/user/proxy/edit/your_proxy_id' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'X-API-Public-Key: your_public_key' \
  --header 'X-API-Private-Key: your_private_key' \
  --data '{
    "proxy_username": "unique_username",
    "proxy_password": "unique_password"
  }'
```

<Note>
  You can use different authentication methods for different proxies within the same account at the same time.

<Warning>
  Proxy-Specific Authentication makes user-level tracking more challenging as all usage is attributed to the default proxy user.
