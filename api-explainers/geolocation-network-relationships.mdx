# Geolocation & Network Relationships

## Geographic Hierarchy

The Ping Proxies API organizes proxies using a hierarchical geographic structure. Understanding this structure is essential for effectively filtering and selecting proxies based on location.

### Hierarchy Levels

1. **Continent**: The broadest geographical division (e.g., Europe, North America)
2. **Country**: Countries within each continent, identified by ISO two-letter codes (e.g., 'us', 'gb', 'de')
3. **Subdivision**: States, provinces, or regions within a country (e.g., 'us-ca' for California)
4. **City**: Specific cities within subdivisions

### API Endpoints for Geographic Data

Each level of the hierarchy has dedicated endpoints for retrieval and searching:

```
GET /public/user/continent/search
GET /public/user/country/search
GET /public/user/subdivision/search
GET /public/user/city/search
```

### Example: Location-Based Filtering

To find proxies in a specific location, you can filter using location IDs:

```bash
# Find all proxies in the United Kingdom
curl -X GET 'https://api.pingproxies.com/1.0/public/user/proxy/search?country_id=gb' \
  --header 'X-API-Public-Key: your_public_key' \
  --header 'X-API-Private-Key: your_private_key'

# Find all proxies in London
curl -X GET 'https://api.pingproxies.com/1.0/public/user/proxy/search?city_name=london' \
  --header 'X-API-Public-Key: your_public_key' \
  --header 'X-API-Private-Key: your_private_key'
```

## Network Information

In addition to geographic data, Ping Proxies provides detailed network information for each proxy.

### ASN (Autonomous System Number)

ASNs represent different internet service providers and network operators. Each proxy is associated with a specific ASN, which determines its network characteristics.

```
GET /public/user/asn/search
GET /public/user/asn/retrieve/{asn_id}
```

### ASN Types

Different ASN types provide varied characteristics and use cases:

| ASN Type | Description | Typical Use Cases |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| `isp` | Internet Service Provider networks | General browsing, accessing consumer websites |
| `hosting` | Data center and hosting providers | High-throughput operations |
| `business` | Corporate networks | Accessing enterprise applications |
| `cdn` | Content Delivery Networks | Content-heavy applications |
| `education` | Educational institutions | Academic research |
| `gov` | Government networks | Accessing government services |

### Example: Finding Proxies by Network Type

You can filter proxies by ASN type or specific ASN:

```bash
# Find all proxies on AT&T's network (ASN 7018)
curl -X GET 'https://api.pingproxies.com/1.0/public/user/proxy/search?asn_id=7018' \
  --header 'X-API-Public-Key: your_public_key' \
  --header 'X-API-Private-Key: your_private_key'

# Find all proxies on ISP networks
curl -X GET 'https://api.pingproxies.com/1.0/public/user/proxy/search?asn_type=isp' \
  --header 'X-API-Public-Key: your_public_key' \
  --header 'X-API-Private-Key: your_private_key'
```

## IP Address Geolocation Look Up

You can use the IP geolocation endpoint to get detailed information about specific IP addresses:

```
GET /public/user/ip_address/geolocate/{ip_address}
```

This endpoint returns both external geolocation data and mapped internal objects:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "external": {
      "asn_id": "13335",
      "city_name": "South Brisbane",
      "country_id": "au",
      "latitude": -27.4766,
      "longitude": 153.0166,
      "timezone": "australia/brisbane"
    },
    "internal": {
      "asn": { "asn_id": 13335, "asn_name": "Cloudflare Inc", ... },
      "city": { "city_id": 378778, "city_name": "Brisbane", ... },
      "country": { "country_id": "au", "country_name": "Australia", ... },
      "subdivision": { "subdivision_id": "au-qld", "subdivision_name": "Queensland", ... }
    }
  }
}
```
