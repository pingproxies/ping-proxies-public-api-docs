---

The Ping Proxies billing system is built on Stripe's subscription architecture, providing flexible billing cycles and a credit balance system for managing your proxy services.

## Billing Cycles

Ping Proxies supports three primary billing cycle options:

| Cycle | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Monthly | 1-month billing cycle |
| Quarterly | 3-month billing cycle |
| Annual | 12-month (1-year) billing cycle |

When purchasing a service through the API, you specify the billing cycle using two parameters:

- `cycle_interval`: Always set to `month`
- `cycle_interval_count`: The number of months in the cycle (1, 3, or 12)

For example:

```json
// Monthly billing
{
  "cycle_interval": "month",
  "cycle_interval_count": 1
}

// Quarterly billing
{
  "cycle_interval": "month",
  "cycle_interval_count": 3
}

// Annual billing
{
  "cycle_interval": "month",
  "cycle_interval_count": 12
}
```

<Info>
  Longer billing cycles typically offer better pricing compared to monthly billing.

## Credit System

The credit system serves as a prepaid balance that is used for all API purchases.

### API Purchasing Requirement

<Warning>
  Services can only be purchased via the API using your account credit balance. You must top up your account with credit prior to using the API to make purchases.
</Warning>

### Viewing Your Credit Balance

You can check your current credit balance through the API:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.pingproxies.com/1.0/public/user/customer/retrieve' \
  --header 'X-API-Public-Key: your_public_key' \
  --header 'X-API-Private-Key: your_private_key'
```

The response includes your current credit balance:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "credit_balance": 500,
    // Other customer fields...
  },
  "message": "Customer successfully retrieved."
}
```

### Adding Credit

You can add credits to your account using the checkout endpoint with the credit product:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.pingproxies.com/1.0/public/user/checkout/create' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'X-API-Public-Key: your_public_key' \
  --header 'X-API-Private-Key: your_private_key' \
  --data '{
    "product_code": "credit",
    "quantity": 1,
    "cycle_interval": "month",
    "cycle_interval_count": 1,
    "top_up_amount": 5000
  }'
```

<Note>
  Credit top-ups are one-time purchases, but the API still requires the cycle_interval and cycle_interval_count parameters.
</Note>

## Invoice Generation & Credit Application

Invoices are generated at key points in the service lifecycle:

1. **Initial Purchase**: When you first purchase a service
2. **Renewal**: At the end of each billing cycle
3. **Service Changes**: When service quantity or features are modified

### Automatic Credit Application

When an invoice is generated, the system automatically:

1. Checks your available credit balance
2. Applies the credit to reduce the invoice amount
3. Updates your remaining credit balance

Example of how credit is applied during checkout:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.pingproxies.com/1.0/public/user/checkout/quote' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'X-API-Public-Key: your_public_key' \
  --header 'X-API-Private-Key: your_private_key' \
  --data '{
    "product_code": "isp_us",
    "quantity": 5,
    "cycle_interval": "month",
    "cycle_interval_count": 1
  }'
```

Quote response showing credit application:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "before_discount_total": 1750,
    "credit_balance": 500,
    "customer_credit_balance_applied": true,
    "customer_credit_balance_applied_amount": 500,
    "total": 1750,
    "total_after_applied_credit": 1250
  },
  "message": "Quote generated successfully."
}
```

### Credit Return on Voided Invoices

If an invoice with applied credit is voided or canceled due to lack of payment after 48 hours, the credit is automatically released back to your account balance.

## Invoice Statuses

Invoices can exist in several states:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `draft` | Invoice has been created but not finalized |
| `open` | Invoice has been finalized and awaiting payment |
| `paid` | Invoice has been paid (either with credit or payment method) |
| `uncollectible` | Payment failed and invoice has been marked as uncollectible |
| `void` | Invoice has been voided and will not be paid |

<Info>
  For API purchases, invoices are typically in either 'paid' status (if covered by credit) or 'open' status (if additional payment is needed).
</Info>

<img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/billing-cycle-dark.svg" alt="Billing Cycle Diagram" />

1. **Service Creation**: A service is purchased through the API using account credit
2. **Initial Invoice**: Generated and marked as paid (if fully covered by credit)
3. **Service Activation**: Service becomes active after payment
4. **Renewal Invoice**: Generated at the end of the billing cycle
5. **Automatic Credit Application**: Available credit is applied to the renewal invoice
6. **Service Continuation**: Service continues if payment is successful

## Checking Invoice Status

You can view invoices associated with a service:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://api.pingproxies.com/1.0/public/user/service/retrieve/API-1234-5678' \
  --header 'X-API-Public-Key: your_public_key' \
  --header 'X-API-Private-Key: your_private_key'
```

The response will include the `open_invoice_id` field if there's a pending invoice:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "service_id": "API-1234-5678",
    "service_name": "AT&T ISP Proxies [US]",
    "service_status": "active",
    "open_invoice_id": "in_1TsPgdB2BUlqim5lkTytLb8K",
    // Other service fields...
  },
  "message": "Service successfully retrieved."
}
```
