# Service Adjustments

Service Adjustments provide an audit trail of all service modifications, tracking what changed, who made the change, when it occurred, and the values before and after the adjustment.

## Key Components of a Service Adjustment

Each Service Adjustment contains detailed information to fully document a change:

### Identifiers and Metadata

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `service_adjustment_id` | Unique identifier for the adjustment record |
| `service_id` | ID of the service that was modified |
| `invoice_id` | ID of any invoice generated by this adjustment |
| `service_adjustment_creation_datetime` | When the adjustment was created |
| `service_adjustment_last_update_datetime` | When the adjustment was last updated |

### Type and Status

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `service_adjustment_type` | The type of adjustment (see types below) |
| `service_adjustment_status` | Current status: `pending`, `complete`, or `failed` |

### Source Tracking

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `service_adjustment_is_administrator` | Whether an administrator made the change |
| `service_adjustment_is_automatic` | Whether the system made the change automatically |
| `service_adjustment_is_customer` | Whether a customer made the change |

### Change Documentation

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `service_adjustment_pre` | JSON snapshot of service state before the adjustment |
| `service_adjustment_post` | JSON snapshot of service state after the adjustment |
| `service_adjustment_eval` | Side-by-side comparison of changed values |

## Service Adjustment Types

Service adjustments can be of various types, each representing a different kind of modification:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ingestion` | Initial creation of a service |
| `fulfillment` | Allocation of proxies to a service |
| `remove_proxy` | Removal of proxies from a service |
| `additional_fulfillment` | Adding more proxies to an existing service |
| `update` | General update to service attributes |
| `proxy_replacement` | Replacing proxies with new ones |
| `extension` | Extending the service period |
| `top_up` | Adding additional bandwidth to a residential or mobile service |
| `top_up_and_extension` | Both extending service and adding bandwidth |
| `cancel` | Cancellation of a service |

## Understanding the Adjustment Evaluation

The `service_adjustment_eval` field is particularly useful as it provides a clear, side-by-side comparison of the changed values. This field contains an object where:

- Each key represents a field that was changed
- Each value is an array with two elements:
  - The first element is the value before the change
  - The second element is the value after the change

For example:

```json
{
  "service_expiry_datetime": ["2023-09-14 18:30:00", "2024-09-14 18:30:00"],
  "service_quantity": [5, 10]
}
```

This evaluation shows that the service expiry was extended by one year and the quantity was increased from 5 to 10.

## Special Adjustment Types

### Proxy Replacements

For `proxy_replacement` adjustments, the object will include additional data in a `proxy_replacements` array, which contains records of each proxy that was replaced:

```json
{
  "proxy_replacements": [
    {
      "proxy_replacement_id": 7018,
      "proxy_replacement_ip_address_ipv4": "107.225.73.142",
      "proxy_replacement_new_ip_address_ipv4": "107.225.74.89",
      "proxy_replacement_reason": "customer_request"
    }
  ]
}
```

This shows the old and new IP addresses, as well as the reason for the replacement.

## Where Adjustments Come From

Service adjustments are created automatically in response to various events:

1. **Customer Actions**:
   - Manually editing a service through the dashboard
   - Making changes via the API
   - Canceling a service
   - Adding bandwidth to a residential or mobile service

2. **Administrative Actions**:
   - Support staff making changes to services
   - Manual adjustments by the Ping Proxies team

3. **Automated System Actions**:
   - Automatic fulfillment of newly purchased services
   - Scheduled service renewals
   - System-initiated proxy replacements
   - Error recovery processes

## Accessing Service Adjustments

Service adjustments can be accessed through the API using:

- **Retrieve by ID**: To get details of a specific adjustment
- **Search**: To find adjustments for a particular service or type

When retrieving a service adjustment with a proxy replacement, the response will include details of all replaced proxies to provide a complete picture of what changed.

## How Adjustments Connect to Other Objects

- **Services**: Each adjustment belongs to a specific service
- **Invoices**: Adjustments that involve billing changes reference the corresponding invoice
- **Proxy Replacements**: When proxies are replaced, the adjustment contains replacement details
- **Residential Ledger**: For residential services, bandwidth adjustments may link to ledger entries
- **Mobile Ledger**: For mobile services, bandwidth adjustments may link to ledger entries
