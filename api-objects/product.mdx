| `product_protocol` | string | IP protocol supported by the product (ipv4, ipv6, dual) |
| `product_is_active` | boolean | Indicates if the product is currently active |
| `product_is_available` | boolean | Indicates if the product is available for purchase |

## Product Prices

Each product contains an array of price objects with the following structure:

## Object Relationships

- **Checkout Catalog**: Products are summarized in the checkout catalog for purchase
- **Services**: When purchased, a product creates a service
- **Countries**: Products may be region-specific and tied to particular countries

## Usage Notes

- The `product_stock` indicates real-time availability for purchase
- A value of `0` for `product_stock` means the product is out of stock
- A value of `-1` for `product_stock` means the product has infinite stock (typically for residential products)
- The `product_protocol` indicates which IP versions are supported (IPv4, IPv6, or both)
- The `product_prices` array shows all available pricing options and billing cycles
- For `residential` and `mobile` products, pricing is bandwidth-based rather than per-IP
- The `product_is_per_ip` flag distinguishes between per-IP pricing (datacenter/ISP) and bandwidth-based pricing (residential/mobile)
- Products with `country_id` are region-specific, while those without may be global
- The `price_amount` and `price_tier_amount` are in cents (e.g., 350 means $3.50)

## Product Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `datacenter` | Commercial datacenter proxies with high speed |
| `isp` | Static residential ISP proxies with carrier legitimacy |
| `residential` | Dynamic residential proxies from real consumer connections |
| `mobile` | Dynamic mobile proxies from real mobile devices |
| `credit` | Account credit that can be applied to purchases |
