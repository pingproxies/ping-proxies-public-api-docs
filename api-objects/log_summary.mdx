description: 'Understanding the Log Summary object and its role in the Ping Proxies API'
---

The Log Summary object represents aggregated usage data for proxies in the Ping Proxies system. It provides a consolidated view of proxy usage patterns over time, offering insights into bandwidth consumption, request counts, and more, without the granularity of individual log entries.

## Key Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `log_summary_id` | string | Unique identifier for the log summary |
| `proxy_user_id` | string | ID of the proxy user whose activity is summarized |
| `customer_id` | integer | ID of the customer account associated with the summary |
| `log_summary_network` | string | Network type (`datacenter`, `isp`, or `residential`) |
| `log_summary_hostname` | string | Domain that was accessed through the proxy |
| `log_summary_requests` | integer | Total number of requests during the period |
| `log_summary_bytes` | integer | Total bandwidth usage in bytes |
| `log_summary_period` | datetime | Time period the summary represents |
| `log_summary_creation_datetime` | datetime | When the summary was created |
| `log_summary_last_update_datetime` | datetime | When the summary was last updated |

## Object Relationships

The Log Summary object connects several other entities in the Ping Proxies system:

- **Customer**: Each log summary is associated with a specific customer account
- **Proxy User**: Log summaries track usage for specific proxy users
- **Logs**: Raw logs are aggregated into log summaries
- **Residential Ledger**: Both log summaries and residential ledger track bandwidth usage, but serve different purposes (analytics vs. billing)

## Related Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /public/user/log_summary/retrieve/{log_summary_id}` | Retrieve a specific log summary |
| `GET /public/user/log_summary/search` | Search log summaries with filters |
| `GET /public/user/analytics/graph` | Generate visualizations from log summary data |

## Data Retention and Analytics

Log Summaries follow a tiered retention and aggregation policy:

- **First 90 days**: Organized by `proxy_user_id`, `network`, and `hostname`
- **After 90 days**: Further consolidated to just `proxy_user_id` and `network` level (hostname details are removed)
- **Long-term storage**: Maintained indefinitely but with reduced granularity
- **Analytics Integration**: The `/analytics/graph` endpoint processes data from both raw logs and log summaries, providing comprehensive analytics regardless of data age

This provides an efficient way to analyze historical usage patterns without storing every individual request.

## Usage Notes

- Log Summaries are automatically generated daily for active proxy users
- They provide a more efficient way to analyze usage trends compared to raw logs
- The `log_summary_hostname` field is only available for summaries less than 90 days old
- For residential proxies, the `log_summary_bytes` directly correlates with bandwidth consumption
- Use the `/analytics/graph` endpoint for visualizing log summary data over time with flexible time intervals (minute, hour, day, month)
- Log Summaries and Residential Ledger track related data but serve different purposes:
  - Log Summaries focus on usage patterns and analytics across all proxy types
  - Residential Ledger specifically tracks bandwidth changes for billing purposes
  - While not directly linked, the data from both should reconcile in aggregate
