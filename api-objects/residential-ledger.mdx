description: 'Understanding the Residential Ledger object and its role in the Ping Proxies API'
---

The Residential Ledger object represents a record of residential bandwidth usage or allocation in the Ping Proxies system. It serves as a complete audit trail that tracks all changes to the residential bandwidth pool associated with a customer account, including daily usage consumption, top-ups, service purchases, and administrative adjustments.

## Key Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `residential_ledger_id` | string | Unique identifier for the ledger entry |
| `residential_ledger_bytes` | integer | Amount of bandwidth in bytes associated with this ledger entry |
| `residential_ledger_requests` | integer | Number of requests associated with this ledger entry |
| `residential_ledger_period_date` | string | The date this ledger entry is associated with |
| `residential_ledger_reason` | string | Reason for the ledger entry (e.g., "usage", "top_up", "service_purchase") |
| `service_id` | string | ID of the related service if applicable |
| `service_adjustment_id` | integer | ID of the related service adjustment if applicable |
| `residential_ledger_creation_datetime` | datetime | When the ledger entry was created |
| `residential_ledger_last_update_datetime` | datetime | When the ledger entry was last updated |

## Object Relationships

The Residential Ledger object is connected to several other objects in the Ping Proxies API:

- **Customer**: Each residential ledger entry belongs to a customer account
- **Service**: Entries may be associated with a residential service (e.g., when purchasing additional bandwidth)
- **Service Adjustment**: Entries may be linked to service adjustments (e.g., refunds or manual adjustments)
- **Proxy User**: While not directly linked, proxy users consume bandwidth which creates ledger entries

## Ledger Entry Types

Residential ledger entries have various reason types that indicate different bandwidth changes:

| Reason | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `usage` | Daily decrements to the bandwidth pool from proxy usage |
| `top_up` | Increments from purchasing additional bandwidth |
| `adjustment` | Manual adjustments (positive or negative) made by administrators |

## Usage Notes

- The residential ledger is maintained at the account bandwidth pool level, not per proxy
- Usage entries are aggregated daily, providing a day-by-day audit trail of bandwidth consumption
- Entries with positive `residential_ledger_bytes` values add to your bandwidth pool (top-ups, purchases)
- Entries with negative `residential_ledger_bytes` values subtract from your bandwidth pool (usage)
- The `residential_ledger_period_date` field indicates the specific day when usage occurred or changes were made
- Unlike datacenter and ISP proxies, residential proxies operate on a bandwidth-based billing model
- There is no automatic expiration for residential bandwidth - it remains in your account until consumed
- For real-time bandwidth status, use the `/residential/summary` endpoint
