| `service_id` | string | Unique identifier for the service |
| `service_name` | string | Name of the purchased service |
| `service_type` | string | Type of service (datacenter, isp, residential, off_catalog) |
| `service_protocol` | string | IP protocol of the service (ipv4, ipv6, dual) |
| `service_quantity` | integer | Number of proxies in the service |
| `service_status` | string | Current status of the service |
| `service_cycle` | string | Billing cycle of the service (e.g., "1:month") |
| `service_expiry_datetime` | datetime | When the current billing period ends |
| `service_total` | integer | Cost of the service in cents |

| `service_metadata` | object | Custom metadata for tracking and organization |
| `country_id` | string | Country code where the service is based |
| `service_fulfillment_filter` | object | Criteria used when provisioning the service |

## Service Status Values

| Status | Description |

| `awaiting_fulfillment` | Service has been paid for but proxies not yet provisioned |
| `awaiting_manual_fulfillment` | Service needs manual intervention by staff |
| `awaiting_additional_fulfillment` | Service needs more proxies to be provisioned |
| `active` | Service is active and available for use |
| `paused` | Service is temporarily paused |
| `overdue` | Payment is overdue for the service |
| `canceled` | Service has been terminated |
| `complete` | Service has completed its term (for non-recurring services) |

## Object Relationships

The Service object is connected to several other objects in the Ping Proxies API:

- **Customer**: Each service belongs to a customer account
- **Proxies**: Services contain individual proxy objects
- **Service Adjustments**: Track changes or modifications to the service
- **Invoices**: Financial records associated with the service
- **Product**: The product template the service was created from
- **Proxy Users**: Authentication entities that can access the service

## Usage Notes

- A service can contain multiple proxies, up to the `service_quantity` value
- The `service_fulfillment_filter` allows you to target specific ASNs or regions
- Services automatically renew based on the `service_cycle` unless `service_is_pending_cancellation` is true
- The `service_metadata` field can be used to organize services by project, client, or department
- When a service is canceled, all associated proxies are deprovisioned
- To view proxies associated with a service, use the `proxies=true` parameter when retrieving the service
