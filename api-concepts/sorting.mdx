# Sorting Results

The Ping Proxies API provides sorting capabilities that allow you to control the order of returned results. Proper sorting is essential for creating intuitive, user-friendly interfaces and for optimizing data processing workflows.

## The `sort_by` Parameter

All search endpoints in the Ping Proxies API support the `sort_by` parameter, which allows you to specify fields to sort by and the direction of the sort.

## Basic Sorting

The simplest form of sorting uses a single field name without any suffix, which sorts in ascending order (A-Z, oldest to newest):

```
GET /public/user/proxy/search?sort_by=proxy_creation_datetime
```

This sorts results by the creation datetime in ascending order (oldest to newest).

## Sort Direction

You can specify the sort direction by adding a direction suffix:

- Ascending: Add `_asc` suffix (default when no suffix is specified)
- Descending: Add `_desc` suffix

```
GET /public/user/service/search?sort_by=service_expiry_datetime_desc
```

This sorts services by expiry date in descending order (expiring soonest first).

```
GET /public/user/proxy/search?sort_by=country_id_asc
```

This sorts proxies by country ID in ascending order (A-Z).

## Multi-Field Sorting

The Ping Proxies API currently supports sorting by a single field at a time. If you need results ordered by multiple criteria, you'll need to perform additional sorting in your application after retrieving the data.

## Available Sort Fields

Most fields available in the response can be used for sorting. Common sortable fields include:

### For Proxy Resources
- `proxy_id`
- `proxy_creation_datetime`
- `proxy_last_update_datetime`
- `proxy_status`
- `country_id`
- `city_name`
- `asn_id`

### For Service Resources
- `service_id`
- `service_creation_datetime`
- `service_expiry_datetime`
- `service_name`
- `service_type`
- `service_quantity`
- `service_status`

### For Log Resources
- `log_creation_datetime`
- `log_request_datetime`
- `log_total_bytes`
- `country_id`
- `log_hostname`

## Special Sorting Options

### Random Sorting

Some endpoints support a special `random` sort option:

```
GET /public/user/proxy/search?sort_by=random
```

This returns results in a random order, which can be useful for:
- Load balancing across multiple proxies
- Selecting random samples for testing
- Presenting different options to users

<Note>
Random sorting should not be used with pagination if you need to access the complete randomly ordered set, as each page will have its own random order.
</Note>

## Sorting and Pagination

Sorting works in conjunction with pagination. When you specify both a sort order and pagination parameters, the API:

1. Applies the sort to the entire result set
2. Divides the sorted results into pages
3. Returns the requested page

For example:

```
GET /public/user/proxy/search?sort_by=proxy_creation_datetime_desc&page=2&per_page=25
```

This returns the second page of proxies, with 25 proxies per page, sorted by creation date from newest to oldest.

## Sorting Performance Considerations

Keep these performance considerations in mind when using sorting:

- **Indexed vs. Non-indexed fields**: Sorting by indexed fields (like IDs) is typically faster than non-indexed fields
- **Consistency**: For paginated results, maintain the same sort parameters across page requests to ensure consistency

## Best Practices

1. **Default sort order**: Choose a sensible default sort order for your application (often creation date descending)
2. **User preferences**: Allow users to change sort order based on their needs
3. **Indicate sort order**: Make the current sort order visible in your user interface
4. **Optimize for common use cases**: Identify the most important sorting needs for your application

## Examples for Common Use Cases

### Show newest items first

```
GET /public/user/service/search?sort_by=service_creation_datetime_desc
```

### Alphabetical order by name

```
GET /public/user/proxy/search?sort_by=proxy_ip_address_asc
```

### Find proxies expiring soon (earliest first)

```
GET /public/user/service/search?sort_by=service_expiry_datetime_asc
```

### Sort logs by size (largest first)

```
GET /public/user/log/search?sort_by=log_total_bytes_desc
```

By effectively using the sorting capabilities of the Ping Proxies API, you can create more intuitive and efficient applications that present data in the most useful order for your specific needs.
