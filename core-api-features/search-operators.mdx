The Ping Proxies API supports powerful search operators that enable advanced filtering beyond simple exact matching. These operators let you craft precise queries to find exactly what you need.

## Available Operators

The following operators are available when searching across most resources:

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `min_` | Greater than or equal (≥) | `min_proxy_user_residential_bytes_limit=1000000` |
| `max_` | Less than or equal (≤) | `max_proxy_user_residential_bytes_used=500000` |
| `like_` | Contains substring | `like_service_name=residential` |
| `not_` | Not equal | `not_proxy_user_is_deleted=true` |
| `exists_` | Key existence check | `proxy_user_metadata.exists_client_id=1` |

## Using Numeric Comparison Operators

### Minimum Value (`min_`)

The `min_` prefix finds items where the specified field is greater than or equal to the value:

```
GET /public/user/service/search?min_service_quantity=10
```

This returns services with a quantity of 10 or more.

### Maximum Value (`max_`)

The `max_` prefix finds items where the specified field is less than or equal to the value:

```
GET /public/user/log_summary/search?max_log_summary_bytes=1000000
```

This returns log summaries with 1MB or less bytes transferred.

### Combining Min and Max

You can combine `min_` and `max_` to create range queries:

```
GET /public/user/proxy_user/search?min_proxy_user_creation_datetime=2023-01-01T00:00:00Z&max_proxy_user_creation_datetime=2023-12-31T23:59:59Z
```

This returns proxy users created during the 2023 calendar year.

## Text Search Operators

### Substring Matching (`like_`)

The `like_` prefix performs a case-insensitive substring search. You can use the `%` wildcard character to match any sequence of characters:

```
GET /public/user/service/search?like_service_name=%premium%
```

This returns services with "premium" anywhere in their name (e.g., "Premium ISP", "ISP Premium Plan").

You can also use the `%` wildcard more specifically:
- `like_service_name=premium%` - matches strings that start with "premium"
- `like_service_name=%premium` - matches strings that end with "premium"
- `like_service_name=pre%mium` - matches strings that start with "pre" and end with "mium"

## Boolean Operators

### Negative Matching (`not_`)

The `not_` prefix finds items where the field does not equal the specified value:

```
GET /public/user/proxy_user/search?not_proxy_user_is_strict_security=true
```

This returns proxy users that do not have strict security enabled.

## Existence Operators

### Key Existence Check (`exists_`)

For metadata fields, you can check if a key exists (or doesn't exist):

```
GET /public/user/proxy_user/search?proxy_user_metadata.exists_department=1
```

This returns proxy users that have a "department" key in their metadata.

To find entries where a key doesn't exist:

```
GET /public/user/proxy_user/search?proxy_user_metadata.exists_department=0
```

## Metadata Filtering

The operators work seamlessly with metadata fields:

- **Exact match**: `proxy_user_metadata.project=Marketing`
- **Minimum value**: `min_proxy_user_metadata.priority=3`
- **Maximum value**: `max_proxy_user_metadata.cost_center=5000`
- **Contains substring**: `like_proxy_user_metadata.client_name=%Tech%`
- **Not equal**: `not_proxy_user_metadata.is_test=true`

## Date and Time Filtering

Dates and times use ISO 8601 format and work with `min_` and `max_` operators:

```
GET /public/user/service/search?min_service_creation_datetime=2023-06-01T00:00:00Z
```

## Combining Multiple Filters

You can combine multiple operators in a single request to create complex queries:

```
GET /public/user/proxy/search?proxy_type=isp&country_id=gb&min_proxy_creation_datetime=2023-01-01T00:00:00Z&not_proxy_status=pending_deletion
```

This returns ISP proxies in Great Britain created after January 1, 2023, that are not pending deletion.

<Note>
When you combine multiple filters, they are joined with AND logic - all conditions must be met for an item to be included in the results.
</Note>

## Limitations

- Not all fields support all operators. Generally, numeric and string fields support their appropriate operators.
- The `like_` operator performs simple substring matching, not regex or advanced pattern matching.
- Operator names are case-sensitive (`min_` works, but `MIN_` doesn't).

## Best Practices

1. **Start specific**: Begin with more specific filters to reduce the result set
2. **Validate inputs**: Ensure values provided to operators are valid to avoid unexpected results
3. **Consider performance**: Very broad queries with operators may be resource-intensive
4. **Remember pagination**: Even with filters, you may need to paginate through results

By mastering these search operators, you can efficiently find and filter resources within the Ping Proxies API, reducing unnecessary data transfer and processing in your applications.
